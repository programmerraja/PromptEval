live data need to use for testing
    - 

NEED Eval for live data and need to filter out what are valid need to different the problem with transcript or prompt


Prompt
    - 


We cannot take all live data and use for EVAL which mostly not valid first we need to know what we trying to achevie.


Extract new transcript by recording and use that for EVAL 
before that we need clarity on what we want from the EVAl what we trying to see 
 does llm handled correctly handled based on prompt etc

Then based on eval and case we need to pick conversation that we need for our dataset for our future testing.


Ok now how i test our prompt?

  user can create case and create mock for our tool and save that case and reuse and create multiple case like that.
