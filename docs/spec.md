🧭 PRODUCT SPECIFICATION DOCUMENT Project Title: PromptEval Tagline: Frontend-only LLM Prompt Evaluation, Auto-Eval, and Style Simulation Platform

🎯 Vision and Goals PromptEval is a frontend-only web application for prompt engineers, researchers, and developers who need to:
Rapidly test, compare, and evaluate prompts across models. Automate evaluation using LLM-vs-LLM judging (auto-eval). Test multi-turn conversations (dialogue scenarios). Extract and reuse user communication styles for simulation. Store and manage all data locally in the browser (no backend). Organize prompts, datasets, and evaluations by folders and tags. Everything — prompts, configs, chat histories, datasets, and evaluation results — is stored in IndexedDB / LocalStorage and can be exported/imported as JSON as single JSON file.

🧩 System Architecture 2.1 Architecture Overview Frontend-only (SPA) architecture built with:
Framework: React + Vite State Management: Zustand UI Components: TailwindCSS + shadcn/ui Local Persistence: IndexedDB (via Dexie.js) Visualization: Recharts API Layer: OpenAI / Anthropic / Others via user-supplied keys use https://ai-sdk.dev/ No backend server. All interactions with APIs are direct from browser → model endpoint using user’s API key.

2.2 Data Persistence Strategy Data Type Storage Layer Notes Prompt versions, conversations, datasets, eval results IndexedDB Structured, queryable API keys, theme, preferences LocalStorage Scoped to browser Export/Import JSON File For cross-device portability 3. 🧱 Core Modules 3.1 Dashboard (Home Page) Purpose: Quick visual overview and actionable insights.

Features:

Prompt Summary Table: | Prompt | Versions | Avg Score | Best Model | Last Eval | |--------|----------|-----------|------------|-----------| | BankingBot | 3 | 4.5 | gpt-4o-mini | 2d ago |

Quick Actions:

➕ New Prompt ▶️ Run Eval 📦 Import Dataset Auto-save indicator (top-right spinner + check mark when data is persisted locally)

Restore previous session button on startup

State diffs visible before export (highlight changed objects)

UX Note: Dashboard is read-only, action-driven — no editing here.

3.2 Prompts Page Purpose: Manage and test prompt versions with integrated workspace.

Left Pane: List of prompts → show name + version count + last modified Clicking expands a dropdown of versions (v1, v2, etc.) Folder organization and tagging system Right Workspace Tabs: Tab Description 🧩 Editor System + user prompt editing area with collapsible JSON config for parameters 💬 Playground Full chat interface — where user can chat and test the prompt conversation log, "Add to Dataset" button 🤖 Auto Chat (LLM-vs-LLM) Define "how user behaves by choosing dataset" and run two-model conversation inline (Mini Multi-Chat) 📈 Eval Results Displays past eval scores for this prompt (uses eval_results), with quick compare and "Run Eval" CTA linking to Eval page Action Buttons: 💾 Save Changes / Save as New Version 🔄 Clone Version UX Flow: User can stay within one prompt → test → eval → save dataset without context switching.

3.3 Prompt Playground (Integrated) Purpose: Allow users to test prompts interactively within the Prompts page.

Features:

Input field for prompt Model selector (e.g. GPT-4, Claude, Mistral, etc.) Config panel (temperature, max tokens, system prompt, top_p, etc.) Output display (streaming supported) where user can chat with the model and see the conversation Token & latency display "Save as dataset entry" and "Save as new version" buttons Playground Sessions - temporary chat sessions that can be saved as conversations or datasets Playground Session Schema:
